# Rust Examples
This repository contains several example programs written in Rust.

## Selenium Manager
These examples are used as warm up for the upcoming Selenium Manager, which is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool developed within the [Selenium] project. This tool implements the concept of batteries included for Selenium. In other words, it allows managing the required browser and driver infrastructure for Selenium WebDriver in an automated fashion, allowing a more pleasant user experience for Selenium users.
